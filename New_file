Why Line System.out.println(m) in the below code is showing compilation error?
class X
{
   	 private int m = 48;
}
 
class Y extends X
{
    		void Print()
    	{
      		  System.out.println(m);
   	 }
}
Options:
a) Because, private field ‘m’ is visible to class Y.
b) Because, private field ‘m’ is not visible to class Y.
c) Because, private field ‘m’ is accessible to X & Y.
d) Because, private field ‘m’ cannot be initialized.
